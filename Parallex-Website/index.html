            <p class="text"> Life is a fatal adventure. It can only have one end. So why not make it as far-ranging and free as possible.
                <br> <br>
                A journey is best measured in friends rather than miles.

            <p class="text"> Life is not about waiting for the storms to pass: it’s about learning how to ride in the rain
                <br> <br>
                I don’t really feel like going for a ride today. Said no motorcycle rider ever.

            <p class="text">The beautiful mountains, the greenery, the weather, everything is just so perfect. And paragliding adds a dash of adventure to the tranquil atmosphere
                <br> <br>
                It is a perfect place for adventure junkies as well as country lovers. Bir is the take-off site and Billing, which is located at a distance of about 14 km from it, is the landing site.

                The three most important things in life: surf, surf, surf
